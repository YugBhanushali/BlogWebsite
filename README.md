#Blog Website

I have made this Blog website using node js, express js, ejs, and mongodb for database

In this project one can compose a blog by giving title and writing the content of the blog also after composing if you wish to edit the blog afterwards you can change or update the post and if you want to delete the post you can do that also.

Here are some images of the project
